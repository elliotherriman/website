Hi! I'm Elliot Herriman, a writer based somewhere between Western Australia and New York. 

Some minor claims to fame include...

- Writing on *Undiscovered*, a short film screened at SXSW, Palm Springs, Clermont-Ferrand, and TIFF, among others. 

- Winner of Scout Film Festival's Emerging Storytellers grant in 2019, in collaboration with Sara Litzenberger.

- I don't have a third thing yet.

- But hey, hit me up! Maybe we can work something out.
