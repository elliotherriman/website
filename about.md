Hi! I'm Elliot, and technically, I have an iMDB page.


I'm a writer based in Western Australia, and am currently earning a double major in communications and computer science. I'll be posting an assortment of pieces on here, most of which will be either narrative fiction, or opinion pieces. Some of these pieces may be worth reading, but I can't make any promises.


If you want to complain about anything I've written, you can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/elliotherriman), or by email.
