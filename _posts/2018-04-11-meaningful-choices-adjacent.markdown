_"This game series adapts to the choices you make," and other lies worth defending._

Hey! So!

This is an unfinished piece, entirely unedited and probably a poor representation of my abilities as a writer. I'm leaving it hosted while I bring my website's design up to scratch, but it may go unfinished until that point. Until then, feel free to write your own ending!

**I.**

Wrestling is scripted. Of course it is. At this point, it's as open a secret as they come — but try bringing it up with any fan and you'll get the same speech they've spent dozens of poor souls perfecting. Yes, they know. No, they don't care. It's better this way, because what you call fake, they call kayfabe.

Originally thought to have originated from the carnival scene, kayfabe is the idea that professional wrestlers and the like should never let their audience see behind the curtain. Wrestlers are expected to stay in character both on–stage and off, and commentators treat twists and turns like they never saw them coming. The façade of non-fiction is maintained at any cost - and as far as I can tell, the fans wouldn't have it any other way. 

It all seems to come down to one simple idea — wrestling is just more entertaining when the theatrics are played up. Of course fans know that The Undertaker isn't an immortal necromancer who once buried a man in cement - but holy _shit_ is it so more fun to watch that guy on stage than a fifty three year old Texan called Mark William Calaway. As far as they see it, kayfabe is what sets professional wrestling apart from other sports. It allows for longer fights, a lower risk of injury to its participants[^1], and most crucially, more engaging and rewarding narratives. To fans, these wrestlers aren't athletes, but *characters*. Without them, without keyfabe, the spell is broken. 

These days, even though it's an open secret that wrestling is "fake", wrestlers still maintain kayfabe — especially during performances. It would be one one thing for them to admit off–stage that their rivalries were played up, or for the WWE themselves to [post an opening for writers](https://wwecorp.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/wwecorp/). It would be another thing entirely for a wrestler to say those things in the middle of a pay-per-view. In other words, breaking kayfabe isn't the equivalent of the post-credits scene in Ferris Beuller or a quick quip from Deadpool. It would be like Kermit's puppeteer tapping out half way through a show. 

Kayfabe is a lie, yes, but it's a lie for the sake of the viewer's enjoyment. 

Which brings me nicely to... this.

# II.

Although Telltale Games first made themselves known with a series of largely comedic point and click adventure games, the success of The Walking Dead - an episodic game with a heavy emphasis on narrative and player choice - was undoubtedly the driving force behind their pivot towards story-based episodic games. To that end, the epigraph above has appeared at the start of every title from Telltale Games since The Walking Dead, in 2011[^2]. The words have been carefully chosen, I have no doubt, designed to put its audience in the right frame of mind for what's to come. Your actions will have consequences, they seem to say. This world is alive, and your choices will matter.

Only, they often don't. Telltale Games have long faced criticism for leading players to believe that their choices will influence the game's narrative to an extent that Telltale has never been able to provide. Player choice may alter lines of dialogue or even the direction of entire scenes, but the broad story beats are seemingly set in stone. Sure, you might be forced to choose which of two characters you'll rescue from certain death, but whoever you save will end up dead too just a few hours later. Five possible endings to this game? Okay, fine, but the sequel's going to undo all of them.

Which all makes a certain kind of sense, of course. Game development is incredibly expensive. If players could alter the course of a game, it would force the development of alternate scenes or even entire episodes, which in turn leads to blown out budgets and for an independant studio like Telltale, probable bankruptcy. 

Yet I can't help but remember finishing the first season of The Walking Dead and heading straight to some forum or other in the hope of finding out what the choices I hadn't made might have lead to. Turns out, they lead to... the exact same thing that I saw. I distinctly recall a flowchart someone posted, showing all the possible outcomes based on player choices. It was more or less a straight line down. It's not as if that can take away from the experience I had the first time, of course, but it left me with something of a sour taste in my mouth that I couldn't quite explain. The Wolf Among Us, season two of The Walking Dead, and Tales from the Borderlands were all great, too, but... the exact same thing happened, sour mouth and all. I tried getting into Game of Thrones. I *got* into Game of Thrones. The ending for the first episode was fun and its ending was genuinely shocking. Until I realised that... yep, no matter what I choose, the same thing will happen. Again, and again, and again.

I'm not the first person to say it, but it bears repeating. Telltale Games have mastered the illusion of player choice. They make it seem like our choices will matter more than they ever could. Telltale's claim that their games will "[adapt] to the choices you make" feels almost deceptive at this point, only true on a technicality. There's a reason I've never been able to replay one of their games, no matter how much I enjoyed it the first time through. I've been on reddit, and I've been on YouTube. I've seen the other endings, which is to say I've seen behind the curtain. I know that, once again, my choices don't matter. 

And yet the same exact epigraph appears at the start of every single one of their titles. 

As well it should. 

I want to be very, very clear on this. I have no intention of criticising Telltale Games, or any of their writers, past or present, for failing to meet audience expectations, regardless of where those expectations came from. What the Mass Effect trilogy managed with Kaidan and Ashley simply isn't realistic for an independent studio operating on a fraction of Bioware's budget. To actually provide the kind of branching narratives that players expect from Telltale would be almost impossible with their resources, and I have no doubt they've known this for longer than the rest of us.

No, I'm here to offer a defense of Telltale Games. Of how this studio overcame practical and financial limitations to consistently deliver games with choices that _feel_ meaningful, even if they aren't. It's all a lie, of course, but it's a lie for our own enjoyment, and by the time we've seen behind the curtain, the credits have long since rolled. Telltale Games must know we'll figure out their trick, but they're still pulling it, because the illusion of player choice doesn't have to hold up through your second playthrough – it just has to last through your first.

[^1]: The risk of injury in professional wrestling isn't non-existant, as I'm sure many would be quick to point out. The stunts that performers undertake are, of course, often just as risky as they are physically demanding. That said, these stunts are largely planned out ahead of time, and all performers involved are presumably more interested in putting on a good show than hammering their opponent's head into the canvas. 

[^2]: Every single title, that is, bar Poker Night 2 - a game that began development before The Walking Dead's release.
