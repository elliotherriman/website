_"This game series adapts to the choices you make," and other lies worth defending._

Wrestling is scripted. I know it. We all do. The fans more than anyone.

As far as hot takes go, the idea that wrestling is "fake" seems to elicit groans every time it's brought up in fan circles. Yes, they know. Yes, they don't care. It's better this way, they say. Because what you call fake, they have another name for. 

kayfabe. 

Originally thought to have originated from the carnival scene, kayfabe is the idea that professional wrestlers and the like should never let their audiences see behind the curtain. Wrestlers are expected to stay in character both on stage and off, and commentators treat twists and turns like they never saw them coming. The faÃ§ade of non-fiction is maintained at any cost - and as far as I can tell, the fans wouldn't have it any other way. 

Every fan I've talked to has said the same thing: wrestling is more entertaining when the theatrics are played up. Of course they know The Undertaker isn't an immortal necromancer who once buried a man in cement - but holy _shit_ is it so much more fun to watch him on stage than a fifty three year old man called Mark William Calaway. Besides, kayfabe sets professional wrestling apart from other combat sports by allowing for longer fights, a lower risk of injury to its participants[^1], and most crucially, more engaging narratives.

This, I would argue argue, is why kayfabe is seen as so important. To the fans, these wrestlers aren't athletes, but *characters*, and without them the spell is broken. Back in the day, reporters were reportedly threatened for attempting to expose wrestling. Now, even though it's an open secret that wrestling is "fake", kayfabe is still maintained at almost any cost. Because it would be one one thing for a wrestler to admit off stage that their rivalries were played up, or for the WWE themselves to [post openings for writers](https://wwecorp.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/wwecorp/). It would be another entirely to say those things in the middle of a pay-per-view. In other words, breaking kayfabe doesn't mean the post-credits scene in Ferris Beuller or a quick quip from Deadpool - it would be like Kermit's puppeteer tapping out half way through a show. Kayfabe is a lie, yes, but it's a lie for the sake of the viewer's enjoyment. 

Which brings me quite nicely to... this.

[^1]: The risk of injury in professional wrestling isn't non-existant, as I'm sure many would be quick to point out. The stunts that performers undertake are, of course, often just as risky as they are physically demanding. That said, these stunts are largely planned out ahead of time, and all performers involved are presumably more interested in putting on a good show than hammering their opponent's head into the canvas.
