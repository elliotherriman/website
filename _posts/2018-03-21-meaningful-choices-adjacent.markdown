_Telltale Games have spent years lying to their players. I think it's about time they got some credit for it._

In professional wrestling, there's a concept known as keyfabe. It's the idea that, on stage or off, wrestlers shouldn't break the illusion that the events and storylines and characters they depict are one hundred percent real. 

They aren't, of course. They can't be. The WWE literally has a character called The Undertaker who is apparently canonically immortal. More importantly, the WWE employs a team of (writers)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_WWE_personnel#Creative_writers], whose job it is to "build compelling ... stories that capture the audience and generate buzz"[^1].
