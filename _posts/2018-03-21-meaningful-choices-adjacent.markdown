_"This game series adapts to the choices you make," and other lies worth defending._

Wrestling is scripted. I know it. We all do. The fans more than anyone.

For the most part, the issue of scripting or "fakeness" is only ever mentioned by those of us who have never watched a wrestling match in their lives. I've watched a couple of episodes of WWE in my time, but I'll admit to having brought it up to fans on occasion - "You must get so bored of people telling you wrestling is fake, right?" - beacuse I honestly love hearing their inevitable explanation as why the scripting doesn't matter to them in the slightest.

Every time, it's come down to the issue of kayfabe. Originally thought to have originated from the carnival scene, the term kayfabe refers to the idea that professional wrestlers and the like should never let their audiences see behind the curtain. Wrestlers are expected to stay in character both on stage and off, and commentators have to treat twists and turns like they never saw them coming. The facade of non-fiction is maintained at any cost - and as far as I've seen it, the fans wouldn't have it any other way. 

Every fan I've talked to has reached the same conclusion: wrestling is more entertaining when the theatrics are played up. Of course they know The Undertaker isn't an immortal necromancer who once buried a man in cement - but holy _shit_ is it so much more fun to watch him on stage than a fifty three year old man named Mark William Calaway. Kayfabe sets professional apart from other combat sports by allowing for longer fights, a lower risk of injury to its participants[^1], and more engaging spectacles and narratives.

This last bit is why kayfabe is upheld. It's one thing for a wrestler to admit off stage that their rivalries were played up, or for the WWE themselves to [post openings for writers](https://wwecorp.wd5.myworkdayjobs.com/wwecorp/). It would be another entirely to say that sort of thing in the middle of a pay-per-view. In other words, breaking kayfabe doesn't mean the post-credits scene in Ferris Beuller or a quick quip from Deadpool - it would be like Kermit's puppeteer tapping out half way through a show.

Kayfabe is a lie, yes, but it's a lie for the sake of the viewer's enjoyment. 

Which brings me quite nicely to... this.

[^1]: The risk of injury in professional wrestling isn't non-existant, as I'm sure many would be quick to point out. The stunts that performers undertake are, of course, incredibly physically demanding, and often just as risky. That said, the stunts are largely planned out ahead of time, and all performers involved are presumably more interested in putting on a good show than hammering their opponent into the canvas.
