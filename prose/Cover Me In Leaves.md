>*Cover Me In Leaves*

It's the end of summer, sunset air weighing down like a blanket, and your fingers trace the lines beneath my sleeve.

You drove me home, and we sat there, parked across from my house, just... waiting. Nervous chatter, stolen glances, giggling,

And then we kissed. 

It's the end of summer, and we're alone on that street, hidden from the prying eyes, and gossipy, gossamer lips.

In a few weeks, you'll be gone for greater things, just another bright mind lost to the coasts. But as you held me, read to me, fingerfucked me behind that long-forgotten strip mall, I could simply... let myself forget.

How soon this all must end.

---

It was a small town, even before I was born there. 

Those grumbling barflies — the uncles and the cousins with overflowing guts and a healthy fear of God — had all held down jobs at that lumbermill, a good twenty five minutes south. They filter from the pews, all restless and stiff. There's a hopelessness here, one that's soaked into their bones. 

It's all rotting now, she says. That mill. But it was the kind of work you could take *pride* in. Chopping logs and packing trucks. They didn't need degrees to do that, you hear?

I nod, and smile, and we pull away from the church yard. A thousand tiny crosses dig into the grass. *A voice for the voiceless.*

Three weeks into fall, and I get my first tattoo. A leaf — just a single leaf — traced out on the soft side of my wrist. It's intricate, and delicate, almost real enough to crunch. Small enough to hide, but enough to hide behind, y'know? 

I'm sure you know. 

I start going for walks. Long walks amongst the pines. There's nothing but forests here. I can let myself feel lost. But when I think of you, think of anyone, think of what they might say, there's this scratching, screeching, peeling at my eardrums,

It's Sunday, and I'm alone in the house. They only bother forcing me out to the weddings and the funerals. I turn on the radio and let someone else choose the music for once. The crickets hum, and the sun shines, and I'm allowed to exist. 

Three minutes past noon means three minutes late to work, and something *thwumps* against my car. In my rear-view mirror, on the road, is a deer. A deer. A rotten, splintered husk of a deer. I kneel down to make sure this wasn't my fault, but it's been here for days, so I get back into my car and I drive towards work. It wouldn't have hurt, right? This is natural. 
This is natural.

It's ashes and dust.

Did I tell you? I've been working at that old place in town. I'm not much of a bartender, but it's not much of a bar, either. And the tips are good. Plus--

Well, the tips are good.

I bought myself a tarot deck the other week. I don't really think it *works*, but the rest of it is nice. It's calming. A little introspective. It helps. I sweep out the emptiness in my room, dressing it up in plants and flowers and rocks and a tiny little bird skull I find by the road. 

It's not quite home, but it's close.

My mom comes home one night, smelling faintly of wine. Did you hear about all this nonsense with the bathrooms? 

I bite my tongue.

Remember Jimmy? That kid from, uh... school? Mrs. Turner said she came home to the sight of him tangled up in her finest Sunday wear. Few years back. And she did the only thing that would be *right* for that poor boy.

She had him exorcised, ma.

And it fixed him, didn't it? Can't say it didn't fix him.

There's a beat. I let it happen.

Say, whatever happened to him?

I'll give you three fucking guesses.

It's been a month. Did you know you're supposed to tip your tattoo artists? I had no idea. Had to save up a little extra, this time. Just to make it right. They ask me if my little leaf had healed okay. Any itching? Any redness? Any weeping and bleeding? 

But if you say yes, they might stop you from getting more tattoos, see?

This time, I go bigger. A whole branch, leaves and flowers all curled up together. I'll never be able to hide it now, but now my forearm is *covered*, and perfect, and gentle.

And then it's morning, and my sheets are covered, too.

I strip the bed, and burn the sheets. A new bandage for my arm, a clean bandage. No need to worry. It's healing perfectly. 

It's quiet in the woods, this time of day. Well, all times of day, really, but-- when it's light enough to see, just before the sun hits the trees, there's this moment of quiet. I can't help but savour it. This is how it used to be. 

This is how it could have been. 

You ever think it might have been worth it? Trying to make a stand here? Show the young'uns that they aren't so alone after all?

It's a trek, but I make it to the old lumbermill before sundown. A factory, carved out of the landscape. A landmark. Gangrene. Gangrenous. The metal is rusted, the concrete overgrown. They used to say there weren't birds left to sing in the woods, but I hear them singing now. Nature's calling in her debts. This mill was a body in a box, these years its cremation. Ashes to ashes. Dust to dust.

My ink never drips out here. But at night, I can feel it stirring. At night, it shivers and slithers and peels from my skin. It whispers to me, words of anger and fury and comfort.

And then it's the weekend, and I swing by Mike's. He's always got time, these days. I get a sprig of holly on my ankle, and some flowers on my shoulder. We lock in another appointment. Next Tuesday. I've got big plans for my collarbones. 

Ten past five, and the working crowd filters in. The beer's cheap, but most come for the company. You mustn't have a problem if you never drink alone.

It was a long shift, I remember that much. Most nights, I'd just stand behind the bar, polishing glasses that were already clean. A roughhackled man likes my ink, apparently. They never get handsy, but the devil finds work for idle minds. He tells me that, and people laugh. I smile. I smile as politely as I can. He just can't help his gaze from wandering.

In five years, this bar will be empty, its stone turned to dust. Not entropy, but nature. This town was built on borrowed time. It owes a debt. And when things return to the way they were, the way they should have stayed... 

Time will bury this town, and I won't be dragged down with the rest of you. I make a promise to myself. I swear on whatever I've got left. I'll be gone by Thanksgiving.

The kind of thoughts that get me get through to closing time. 

I peel the bandages from my back, from my ribs. It's not done yet, but it's close. Flowers, branches, trees. I'm covered in ink, now. Covered in leaves. A canopy. It's a reminder, and a shell. Black and green and brown. I'm alive, and I'm held, and I'm safe.

Night. Early morning, maybe. I close up the bar. The long walk home. I don't feel safe, because I'm not safe, but there aren't a lot of options.

So I walk. 

Despite it all, it's a perfect night. Crickets call, and the moon is full. 

An owl hoots. The stars shimmer. 

There's a breeze, and for a single second, I feel alone in the world.

And then I hear him call. 

He's a gangling man, with a stubbled chin. Far too old for me, not that it matters. His car is an awful half–truck with two doors too few, and he hangs out its window with a waggling tongue. 

You heading my way, sweetheart?

I smile. As best I can, I smile. A polite reply, just a few minutes from home, no need to worry.

Oh, but he *insists*. 

There's a patch of damp on my collar. Wet and dark, bleeding through to my shirt. I keep walking. Right foot, left foot.

You got someone to head home to? A boyfriend? A husband? 

I can hear my blood pumping. Moving a little faster. He's out of the truck now, moving towards me. 

Ah, but it's a small town. People talk. He knows me. Of course he knows me. Knows what they say about me. Knows I've never found myself a *real man*. 

You want someone to teach you, then, sweetheart? Let me teach you a few things, show you how a girl's meant to behave. Wouldn't want them thinking you *queer*, would we?

He reaches for me, reaches for my skin--

And then he falters. Falters, and stares, his hands stained black.

It pours from me in waterfalls and streams. Every inch of me is bleeding, bleeding black and brown and green, a cascade of colour. Whispering and screaming and beautiful. All of my anger and fury and comfort, it covers me. It buries me. A forest in flight.

His eyes are wide. So are mine. I'm everything he expected, deep down. I'm everything I was afraid to be. 

And now I reach for *him*.

One by one, I take his bones, and lay them by the riverbed. When winter comes, the waters will rise, and I will never think of him again.

Every inch of him was borrowed. Every speck of dust, every brutal thought. One day, my debt will be paid too. I will be gone, and I will be everything. 

But I will not waste my insignificance. Not like he did. 

I'm not going to die in this town.

My bags are packed. They've been packed for weeks. The bus driver glances at me, the girl with the stained skin and matted hair, but he's not paid enough to ask questions. I find a seat at the back, and collapse. I let myself breathe. I let myself exist.

They stay with me. Every little leaf, every branch and seed and flower. Maybe someday, I won't need them. Maybe someday I'll have grown, and they'll have grown with me. But they're tied to me now. They cling to my skin. So I let myself be held.

The bus pulls out, and just like that, I'm gone. A rumour, a memory, a talking point for the holidays. That's all I can offer them — just another bright mind, lost to the coasts.
