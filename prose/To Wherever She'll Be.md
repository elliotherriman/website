It wasn’t your fault. You never had a chance. 

But you did try. 

And shouldn't that count for something?

---

You wake up on a path. All gravel and stone and point and edge. It’s dawn, or it’s dusk, and the world is grey. 

The smell of rain bleeds through the air. Around you, a prairie. Yellow-green grass stretches from here to the horizon. 

And on that horizon, a house.

It’s an old house, by the looks of it. Small, almost cozy, made of faded brick and yellowed wood. Warm light spills through the windows. You can hear voices echo and chatter within. Glasses clink. A dinner party? And then it’s silent.

You knock.

The door thunks in reply. It’s the kind of door that calls out for a sturdy metal knocker. As it is, it’s just... bare. Thick. Sturdy. Made from a rich, deep wood. 

Your grandmother had doors like these, back when she'd lived in the suburbs. Or-- no. It wasn’t the doors. It was her table. Her dining room table, mahogany made. You’d sit there every time you visited, idly kicking at the legs, watching her bustle around the kitchen. She'd always remind you to use a coaster, as kindly as she could. Cups of... tea? Tea. She made you tea, years before you knew the difference between bitter and bad. You’d make faces, and she’d make them right back. Drink up, it’s good for you. Never mind the taste. But then she’d find some reason to stick her head in some cupboard, and never seemed to stand back up until the sugar bowl had stopped clinking.

You didn’t use coasters, though. You just never thought to, that was the trouble. Because one day, your mom arrived to take you home, and she started reorganising and rearranging, the way she always would. Your brother's done with tennis, so hurry up. But she picked up the cup, and saw the faded wood, and-- 

Your grandmother had smiled. Just... smiled. It’s just a table, never mind the stain. She hugged you, and pinched your cheeks. No harm done. It’s a damn waste of tea, though. Some people might like their tea cold, she said, but that’s why they lost the war. You didn’t understand, but you grinned. You couldn’t help it. And the next time you visited, you remembered to use a coaster.

Grass underfoot. The cicadas whir. A cellar door juts from the ground, bolted shut. You were never allowed down into the cellar as a kid. You used to wonder what’s down there. Now you’ll never know.

The back porch seen better years. There’s an old rocking chair up there, overlooking the garden. It doesn’t have much to look at.

Around you, the prairie whispers.

At the foot of the hill is the tree you'd climb. Water drips from its leaves. You run your hands over the bark, feeling the grooves and notches and carvings. The phrase “old soul” slinks through your mind. This tree has seen lifetimes. 

A makeshift tire swing hangs from the branches. It’s hollowed out, and the bottom half is filled with filthy, swarming, squirming water. You never liked bugs. Or insects, or bugs, or insects. You... never liked bugs.

You had a cat, once. It was summer, and she went missing for a few days, a few weeks. You were the one who found her. The bugs lead you there. You were too young. 

Your dad sat you down. Your mom had been shouting. He looked so tired. He told you everything was okay. Even this.

Sometimes, when a person or animal gets sick, they-- or if they’re old, they might go to sleep for a long time? And they won’t wake up. But that’s okay. Because they know we will always love them. And they’re in a better place now.

Your dad said heaven, not Heaven. You could tell, even then. He held you as you cried. He told you he loved you.

So why did he leave?

The porch's stairs creak and moan. There’s an old rocking chair by the back door, watching over the prairie. You give it a nudge. It grumbles, an elderly cat in the midday sun. 

There’s a dog flap dug into the back door, but you’d never get your shoulders through. Did you have a dog? It doesn’t feel like it. You knock again. There’s no answer. But the door swings open.

The kitchen is bare and peeling. An old yellow-y paint. The floor is a sticky mess. Envelopes cover the counter. Long overdue. You can feel the oven’s heat from here.

Amidst it all, the fridge sits and waits. It’s the only thing in here that isn’t calling out to you. You run your hand over the door, covered in pizza menus and novelty magnets. And a drawing. 

Crayon on printer stock. You and your family. A day at the seaside. You slide it out from under the fridge magnet. It’s not quite clear who’s who, but everyone looks happy. Everyone is smiling. 

It wasn’t quite the sea, she liked to remind you. It's called an estuary. The place where the river meets the sea. A day out with family and friends.

You were a little dumb, but it wasn’t your fault, was it? It’s not like you couldn’t swim. You just had a little too much confidence, and, well, a dare’s a dare. Swim across the river. It didn’t look too far. You could do it, easy.

A few years back, you’d been trying to learn to swim, and the waves crashed into you. You spent a lifetime down there, tumbled against the sand. It wasn’t worth struggling. Either the wave would let go, or it wouldn’t. So you just held your breath. 

That wasn’t like this. You made it halfway before the panic set in. Dark shapes and shadows lurked beneath the surface. Can sharks swim up here from the ocean? God, maybe, probably, I don't know. All the kids from church are watching, jeering. Your muscles start seizing up. Water's slipping through with every breath. 

And then you go under. 

You don’t remember making it back to shore. You don't remember coughing up water. You tried to tell your mom what happened. How you nearly drowned. But you didn’t drown, did you? It wasn’t your time. And you’d had such fun until then. We all had such a nice time. So why don’t you draw us all having a nice time? Building sand castles and sunbathing and-- No, we were smiling, remember? Draw us smiling.

You drew a picture. You were by the beach. You built sandcastles. Your sister was there. You were a family. And everyone is smiling. 

The dining room. The dining table. Your dad was the one who cooked. 

The lounge is carpet and tile. There’s a movie playing on the television set. It’s either muted, or even older than it looks. A fire roars in the fireplace. It roars. You used to love that sound. When you were younger, you used to sit here and watch the fire. It would be dark when you woke. Maybe there’s dinner in the fridge, maybe you’ll have to make it yourself. But you took the time to watch as the fire burnt. The world would wait for you. 

But now the smoke stings at your eyes. You blink away tears. The fire roars, smoke spilling through the room, blinding you, choking you, and--

Upstairs.

Framed photographs cover the walls. You can see yourself in some of them. Your dad isn’t here. There’s a few photos of your sister, but nothing new. She looks so... young. 

It's barely a corridor, really. You step past your old room. A dozen memories pull at you.  you hold your head above water. You make for the master bedroom. Dusty and pink and beige and... plain. Plainer than you remember. The bed is made on one side. The pillows unfluffed. You keep your eyes down, and don’t touch anything.

There’s a single toothbrush on the sink. There. The jewelry box. Beneath the gaud and the gold. A heavy key. It weighs you down, the rust scratching at your palm as you grip it tight. 

The door to the study. Your dad's study. The key fits, and you wrench it open.

Something shifts in the air. Dust shimmers and drifts in the light. Books line the wall, and they greet you as one. A sturdy wooden desk sits in the corner of the room — overlooking the balcony, and the prairie beneath it.

You slide the glass door open, and step outside. From here, you can see everything. The air is fresh, fresher than it’s ever been. Stars speckle the sky. Overgrown grass stretches from here to the horizon, and not an inch further.

I’m sorry about, uh-- I could have handled that better. Your cat had just died, and I... I couldn’t let your mom give you that talk. She doesn’t handle those sort of--

You know.

But uh... your brother’s been real quiet lately, pal. A little scarce. Do you think he’s okay? Has he said anything to you?

You shake your head. You could ask?

He ruffles your hair. It’s okay, I’ll take care of it. 

The stars shine. Let yourself take it in. Take a breath. You’ve got nowhere to be.

But you do. The glass doors are gone, and with it, the study. In its place, a pair of tarnished elevator doors. You take a breath, and step inside. 

The doors slide shut.

And now you’re somewhere else. Another corridor, full of metal pipes and dirt cheap lighting. One staircase, one elevator, no fire escape.

You push through the door with your shoulder. Home. Small and awful and dangerous. Way out of your price range. You have two jobs, and one of them doesn’t even pay. But it’s yours. This place is yours.

You smell smoke. You smell smoke. You breathe smoke. It fills the apartment.

You make for the window, and your boots hit metal. Your sister passes through a six pack, and joins you on the fire escape. It’s stopped snowing, but god damn is it cold.

She’s doing better, third time running. She's married, now. Eloped in March. Same tax breaks, she says, but I get to wear the ring now. You’re doing better, too. That internship actually worked out. It became a career. You can afford the luxuries, you say, patting the fire escape. She laughs. You sit together and watch the traffic, and take a sip every time someone jaywalks.

The world goes past. And you're together.

It’s dark now. You walk her to the subway. She asks if you’re okay, really? You think so. Been to church lately? God, no, not in years. She laughs. She’s had enough for one lifetime. You nod. They burned you out too.


A siren echoes down the street. The smell of smoke is even stronger now, and it fills your lungs.

You watched from your dad's balcony as they drove away. It was night, and the stars shone, and the wind blew, and you were alone.

You’d never seen your mom drunk before. The things she couldn’t burn, she locked away. Your dad’s study was off limits. She had to drag you out of there by the armpit. The next day, there was a lock on the door.

You kept praying. You needed something to drive you. You called her your brother for years. It took you too long to understand. You blamed them for leaving. Earnestly at first, then only on cue. You went to church. You kept praying. You kept your head down.

Years passed.

And then you left, too.

Your first night away from home, you slept in a bus station. 

A week in, and you reach the east coast. 

Three weeks, then a month, and your money runs out. There’s a food pantry nearby, but donations always dry up this time of year, we're so sorry. Maybe you could try that Sikh church, just a few blocks away? 

You hadn’t wanted to. You couldn't. But one way or another, you can’t stay hungry forever.

It wasn't just dinner. They’d stuffed a bag full of food, forced it into your hands. Told you to come back whenever you needed more. 

You barely made it home before the tears came.

You’re in a comfortable room. Calming colours. You’ve made great progress over this last year, she tells you. You can’t meet her eye. Have you thought about calling your sister? Messaging her? Emailing? Of course you have.

This wasn’t your fault. None of it was. Just try to remember that, okay?

You try.

And you keep trying. You try every day, because you have to. Even on the days you beat it, it always comes back. So you keep trying..

For years, there’s been a misery, a fury, that's eaten you alive – but now its teeth are blunt. Not harmless, but blunt. If it’s fury, then you let that fury drive you. Because despite everything, you've found friends to call family. 

You’ve started healing. You've found a place to call home.

One last night.

It scares you to think about, but it's late, and you’re drunk, and you know she’s drunk too. So you ask. About death. About what happens next.

She takes another sip.

It’s hard to unlearn that shit. I think I have? I think. Mostly. But it’s hard, man. Is there a heaven? Fuck, I hope not. If they’re right, I’m sure not getting in. But you know me. I’d never want to be part of any club that wouldn’t have me as a member. 

Reincarnation could be cool, you say. But would you come back as yourself? Or as someone else? She laughs. I can’t say I like the sound of either option.

She has a spark in her eye. Y’know, I reckon we get a choice. We might not even realise it. but maybe... wherever we end up? It’s where we expect to end up. And if you’re not sure, maybe you get to decide. Someone sits you down and lays out all your options, and you get to decide. No one has to be wrong. No one has to be alone. We all just... get what we’re looking for. 

I dunno. Maybe that’s dumb. Maybe there’s just... nothing. She fidgets with the hem of her skirt. Maybe. But you kinda like the thought. 

You sit in silence, her head on your shoulder.

Worst comes to worst, though? She would crush it down hell-side. Three weeks before she’s running the joint.

She laughs. She'll hook you up with a cushy desk job. You drink to that. 

In a few hours, she’ll head home. But not yet. 

You cherish this. 

For one last night, you’re together.

---

You wake up on the couch. Your cheeks are wet. Your lungs are raw and heaving. Embers glow inside the fireplace. You sit on the carpet, and watch them dance. Just for a while.

Is this is where you belong? Here?

Maybe.

Maybe you could try again. You’d like to think you’d do better the next time through.

Or maybe there’s another option. A place of your own. Would she be there?

Maybe it really is up to you. 

You hold your breath. The house stands still. The wind runs its hands through the prairie, and the old oak rustles in reply.

And then you’re gone. To wherever she’ll be.
