**seré, lo que era**

---

The breeze through the trees. And everything was still.

The woman, that strange woman, she lets go of my hand, and disappears through the pines. And then I’m alone, feeling everything and nothing.

A deep breath. A shuddering breath, like the dead back to life. And I am nothing but lost.

It’s time to leave these woods.

---

We made our way past the hollow pines, past the graves of the nameless. And together, we were quiet. A gentle silence. Maybe the first we’ve ever shared.

We walk together, and you talk, and I listen. God, I love your voice. Not just the sound, but the... the everything. It’s so strange to hear, so strange to watch. You never take the path, not quite, veering back and forth, crunching sticks where you can. You scramble down the riverbank, and you laugh, you actually laugh, feeling freer in your skin than I ever have.

I’m really happy for you. I honestly mean that. And it’s so peaceful, now that you’re here. I feel free. That’s all I’ve ever wanted. Just... a chance to rest.

So that’s all I thought to ask for.

I knew what she was. And she knew why I’d found her. There was no pretence, no pretending. I offered her everything I am. A fair trade.

And she looked at me, square in the eyes. Looked at me, looked through me. Looked right through me.

And she smiled.

The wind tussles through your hair, and for a moment, I... fuck, I fucking miss that. The breeze, the cool smell of spring, 

I’m glad you’re here, though. I’m so glad you’re here.

And now the trees are thinner. Above us, somewhere, clouds set out across the sky. You’re catching glimpses now. And I like that. Nothing to hold us in. It’s sunrise, or it’s sunset, and I’ve never seen you so alive. Home can’t be far from here, the forest’s edge, but you drag us down the scenic route. And I can’t help but let you. Free you from your bonds. You just seem so *happy*.

What I’d give to be you.

She asks me my name, and I give it to her. Palms open, arms outstretched. A name I’d never wanted, a bitter taste, but I held it so tight. And as she reaches for me, for my jaw, with a lone, brittle finger, wrenching my chin up to meet her gaze--

*“That’s not your name, child.”*

But she’s not looking at me. Her eyes meet mine, but not... she’s not looking at me. Not really.

She’s not even speaking to me.

*“That has never been your name. But I’ll take it. Let me take it from you.”*

And a part of me nods. 

And then I’m gone.

This was never my story.

It’s summer, the end of spring. And I’m still here.

But you’re letting me go.

I can feel myself fade. Every time you smile, every time she kisses your lips, and you melt, I quiet. I’m here. I’m still here, just... a pale imitation.

I’m happy for you, I meant that. I mean it.

But I’m happy for me now, too.

I like these walks. Through the forest, through the trees. They give you time to think, and I can feel the calmness set in.

You saw her, once. I think. Nothing more than a lunch between friends, no business deals done. Just the cruelty of the forest, the fairest of the other... curious. Looking for an update.

That little pact... somewhere around here. It must have been. There’s a lightness to your breath. A sentimentality. I feel you sit, your back against the moss. And you close your eyes.

You let your guard down.

And I do nothing.

Months ago, weeks ago, any day but today, I’d have come for you. I’d have tried. I’ve had nothing but practice. But as I watch you from this distance, I...

You really are happy.

You’re happy.

And you have to let me go.

So I sit with you. And I listen to the breeze.

The breeze through the trees.

And everything was still.
